          <h1 style="font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Your Restaurant's AI Marketing Department. Open 24/7.</h1>
          <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;"><strong>Campaigns, customer nurturing, reputation management — running 24/7. What restaurants pay agencies RM5,000-10,000/month for. Now automated. You focus on what you opened a restaurant to do: the food.</strong></p>
          
          <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">You Didn't Open a Restaurant to Become a Digital Marketer.</h2>
          <p>You wake up thinking about staff problems. You spend the day fighting fires. You close up at 11pm, exhausted. Somewhere between the supplier crisis and the kitchen drama, you know you should be doing marketing. But when?</p>
          
          <h3>The reality of your "marketing" right now:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You posted on Facebook last month. Got 73 likes. Did anyone actually walk through your door? No idea.</li>
            <li>The phone rang six times during lunch rush yesterday. Your team was slammed serving customers. Those calls went to voicemail. Maybe reservations. Maybe a corporate event. You'll never know.</li>
            <li>Someone messaged on WhatsApp at 9pm asking about your menu. You saw it at midnight. They booked somewhere else.</li>
            <li>You paid RM3,000 for a website two years ago. When's the last time it actually brought you a customer?</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>You're stuck in the Operator Trap — working 14 hours a day in the business, with zero time to work on the business.</strong></p>
          
          <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The Silent Leak in Your Cash Register</h2>
          <p><strong>Miss just ONE call per day? That's RM6,000 walking out your door every month.</strong></p>
          <p>It's 7:30pm. Dinner rush is slamming. The phone rings. Nobody answers. Your team is too busy serving. That missed call wasn't just noise. It was a reservation for 4 people. Average spend: RM50 per head. One call = RM200 gone.</p>
          
          <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Stop Hiring Tools. Hire a Machine.</h2>
          <p>Most "solutions" just give you more work. NorWeb is different. We don't give you software to learn. We give you a system that works while you sleep.</p>
          
          <h3>What NorWeb Actually Is:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>AI-Powered Website</strong> — Not just pages. A lead-capture machine built to convert.</li>

            <li><strong>Auto-Nurture System</strong> — Every visitor becomes a lead. Every lead gets followed up. Every follow-up becomes a booking.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Your POS handles transactions. NorWeb handles attraction. We don't compete with your current systems. We complete them.</strong></p>
          
          <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Meet Your New Marketing Team (They Never Call in Sick)</h2>
          <p>These aren't "bots." They're your digital staff. They work 24/7/365. They speak multiple languages. They know your menu by heart. They never have a bad day.</p>

          <p>NorWeb Growth Plan = RM499/month. Average booking value = RM150. Bookings needed to cover cost = 3.3 bookings. Typical restaurants see 15-30 additional bookings monthly from leads that would have otherwise been missed.</p>
          <p><strong>One Missed Call Pays for the Whole Month.</strong></p>
          
          <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Choose Your Marketing Department</h2>

          <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Questions We Get Over Teh Tarik</h2>
          <h3>I'm not technical at all. Can I actually use this?</h3>
          <p>That's exactly why we built it this way. You don't operate NorWeb — it operates for you. After setup (which we handle completely), you just check your dashboard occasionally. If you can read a WhatsApp message, you can use NorWeb.</p>
          
          <h3>Will this work with my current POS?</h3>
          <p>Yes. NorWeb is POS-agnostic. We don't replace your transaction system — we handle marketing, which your POS doesn't do. They work together, not against each other. Whatever POS you use, NorWeb sits on top.</p>
          
          <h3>How long does setup take?</h3>
          <p>7 days from sign-up to live. We do the heavy lifting: building your website, training the AI on your menu and policies, setting up automations. You just answer some questions about your restaurant and approve the final result.</p>
          
          <h3>What if I don't like it?</h3>
          <p>Cancel anytime. No lock-in contracts. We also offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee — if you're not seeing value, we'll make it right or refund you. We're not here to trap you. We earn your business every month.</p>
          
          <h3>Is the voice AI actually good? Or robotic?</h3>
          <p>Talk to Nova right now. The button is on this page. That's your answer. Our AI uses advanced voice technology trained specifically for restaurant conversations. Most customers don't realize they're talking to AI until the booking is confirmed instantly.</p>
          
          <h3>Do I need to do anything after setup?</h3>
          <p>Check your dashboard. See your bookings. That's it. The AI handles customer inquiries 24/7. If you have menu changes or new promotions, just tell us — we'll update the system. Otherwise, it runs itself.</p>
          
          <h3>What about walk-in customers?</h3>
          <p>NorWeb handles digital and phone customers — the ones who would otherwise slip through the cracks. Your staff stays focused on serving people in front of them. If anything, service IMPROVES because they're not running to answer the phone during rush hour.</p>
          
          <h3>Will customers know they're talking to AI?</h3>
          <p>We can configure it either way. Most customers don't mind — they want fast, accurate answers and instant booking. What matters is they get helped immediately instead of waiting or being ignored.</p>
          
          <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Tomorrow Morning Could Look Different</h2>
          <p>You can wake up tomorrow and: Still have missed calls from last night. Still have unanswered WhatsApp messages. Still have no idea which marketing works. Still be running yourself into the ground.</p>
          <p><strong>Or.</strong></p>
          <p>You can start the 7-day countdown to having an AI marketing department that: Answered every call. Captured every lead. Nurtured every interested customer. Turned interest into bookings. While you slept.</p>
          <p>Your competitors who seem to have it figured out? They don't work harder than you. They just have help.</p>
          <p><strong>The dinner rush is coming. Will you answer the call?</strong></p>
          <p>It's RM499/month. That's less than what you lose on 3 missed bookings.</p>
